# Birth of the idea

## Preface

We are in 2020, in full pandemic, the co-protagonist of the story is my son, 8 years old at the time.

## History

Nowadays we can't think of hypothesizing a pre-adolescent who does not have access to his parents' smartphone, or who does not already have one of his own.
For teenagers the situation is totally different, they are another target (they live in another world :smiley: ), they are different individuals, more mature (in theory or with a good approximation) and in any case they are not as easily manageable as the little ones.

It was like this for my son: for his eighth birthday he received a smartphone made especially for children, with a customized version of Android with specific apps and an advanced level of parental control. But even he is quite advanced, under our supervision he uses his parents' devices for his own amusement (and sometimes even for more serious purposes).\
By choice we didn't insert a SIM in his device (although it could), and WiFi access is under control at home, and `you don't take your cell phone outside the house!` \
The result is that he uses it in an _open_ way, listening to music, using educational apps, some games, and sometimes watching his favorite videos on YouTube (music videos, animals, cartoons) when mom and dad give the ok and enable Wi -Fi for his phone.

Some of his classmates have their own phone with their own SIM and use messaging: it's not up to me to discuss and evaluate the decisions of others (I don't know what level of control or monitoring is implemented), I know the net, I don't see technology as a demon, I just want my boy to approach it as best as possible and I think I have the knowledge to help him understand it and use it best. He has not made any protests or criticisms about it, so I think that our decision is shared or at least not seen as a forcing or a deprivation.

One day he comes looking for me and asks me how to send a message to his best friend: he had opened the SMS app, had written a message (a simple `Hi, what are you doing? I'm playing`) and wrote his first and last name of the friend in the recipient's space. Pushing back a tear of tenderness (this pandemic situation is very heavy for children, they need contact with others even more than adults, they also need it to form their own character) and one of pride (my puppy found itself the solution to his little problem of the moment, he wanted to share an emotion with his friend) I just told him `You can't send a message, I explained to you that you have no SIM in your phone and you can't send messages without a connection`. His lucid answer surprised me but not so much (I know him well!): `But if you want I can connect to the Internet` and then he abandoned the question and went back to playing, leaving me with my thoughts:
- he knows that when he wants to hear from his friends, we can always make a phone call to their respective parents
- he wanted to send a message from _his_ phone, like we do with WhatsApp or similar
- he doesn't have this **brand culture**, he knows and uses our instant messaging tools, but not finding it on his phone he didn't ask me to install it, he opened the _Messages_ app with the simplicity (childood innocence?) of conceptual association between need and app that satisfies it

Here is the spark:
```
Why not create a messaging app that meets his and my needs?
```
- SIM not needed
- User's safety and privacy guarantee
- Control by a supervisor

This is where the idea of **SiSmoChat** was born, an idea that remained in a drawer of my memory until a few days ago (we are at the beginning of 2023), when He always looks out the door of my room and exclaims
```
Do you remember that app to send messages to my friends? Do you haven't done it anymore?
```
Leaving me again with my thoughts, and this time I decided to take it out of the drawer and put it into practice.

Or at leastâ€¦ I will try!
